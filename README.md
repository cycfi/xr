XR Extended Response Pickups

The Cycfi XR Extended Response Pickups utilize low-impedance coils (Lo-Z 350Ω to 500Ω DCR) which 
inherently have full frequency response from 20Hz to 20kHz and beyond. Unlike traditional high-
impedance passive pickups there are no big peaks and dips in the spectrum, typically perceived as 
the pickup’s “character”. That does not mean that Lo-Z pickups lack character. In fact a Lo-Z coil’s 
characteristically wide bandwidth gives it a voice all its own. The pickups are very rich in harmonics, 
with uber-clean sounds, lots of overtones and crystal clear highs. They have a lot more harmonic 
content than even the bright Stratocaster pickup (which has frequency response that rolls off at 
around 5KHz.) On the low end of the audio spectrum you get tight, well-defined and focused bass 
all the way down to 20Hz.
